#Readme Creator

Current work in progress porting my readme-generator repo over using Golang instead of Javascript without the use of external libraries. 

MVP: CLI that takes user input and creates a readme within the repo that contains project information, licensing data, github user info, and iamges if necessary.

May eventually pull portions of project into a template generator using NextJS
